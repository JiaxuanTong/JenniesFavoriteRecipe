                <li>In a large pot over medium heat, combine the butter, water, milk, sugar, and salt. Whisk until the butter is melted and the mixture is steaming, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Quickly whisk the all-purpose and whole wheat flours and the baking powder into the hot milk mixture. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 5 more minutes. Remove the pot from heat and stir with a spatula to cool the dough.
                </li>
                <li>When the dough is no longer hot to the touch, add the eggs one at a time, stirring to incorporate before adding the next.
                </li>
                <li>Add the vanilla and sprinkles and stir to distribute evenly.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a piping bag or zip-top bag fitted with a large star tip.
                </li>
                <li>On a parchment-lined baking sheet, pipe 4-inch (10-cm) circles of dough. Chill in the freezer until solid, about 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a large bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and cream cheese. Whisk until smooth and runny. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
                </li>
                <li>Carefully add the crullers to the hot oil. Fry about 3 at a time for 4-5 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown. The fried crullers should feel much lighter than they were originally. Transfer the fried crullers to a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>While still warm, dip one side of the crullers in the glaze. Return to the wire rack and allow excess glaze to drip off. Top with sprinkles.
